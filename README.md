# STM32F103VET-Microcontroller-Drivers
Dirvers for STM32F103VET Microcontroller which are developed by me. While I'm writting this text I have developed GPIO, SPI, Delay and I2C drivers using CMSIS API. Delay, SPI and GPIO drivers are tested with Hardware but I2C has not been tested yet. But I believe it will work!

I would like to give all credits to my instructor. Without him I couldn't have learned all those things.
